# MDX Test Page

This is a test of MDX in Astro. Here is some standard Markdown content.

- List item 1
- List item 2

## Interactive React Component

And now, for the magic! We can embed a fully interactive React component right here in our Markdown file:

<Greeting
  client:load
  messages={[
    "Welcome to MDX",
    "This is interactive",
    "Hello from a .mdx file",
    "Another message",
  ]}
/>

Isn't that cool? You can mix static content and interactive components seamlessly.
